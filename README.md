# AlgoRand_Covid
Data Project on COVID-19 survey transactions on the Algorand Blockchain in Python via PureStake API.

[IReport-Covid](https://ireport.algorand.org/en) leverages the Algorand blockchain to provide anyone with the means to inform their community and world-at-large of their experience with COVID-19 in a timely and anonymized way. Here I demonstrate how to scrape and process IReport-Covid survey data from the Algorand blockchain in Python and begin analyzing the data.
